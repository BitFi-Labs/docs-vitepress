## Types of Points

- **bfBTC HODL Points**  
  Points earned based on the amount of bfBTC you hold in each epoch.  
  The current rule is: **for every 0.0001 bfBTC you hold, you earn 10 points per epoch**, with points calculated as whole numbers only.  
  For example, if you hold 0.00018 bfBTC, you will earn 10 points per epoch, not 18 points.

- **bfUSD Quest Points**  
  One-time points earned when you complete bfUSD-related quests, such as:  
  - First Mint 100 bfUSD  
  - First Stake 100 bfUSD to Horizon / Pulsar  
  - First Provide 100 bfUSD Curve Liquidity  
  These quests reward a fixed amount of points the first time you complete them.

- **bfUSD HODL Points**  
  Points earned when you continuously hold bfUSD, hbfUSD, pbfUSD, or provide bfUSD liquidity in designated pools (such as Curve).  
  At the end of each epoch, the system grants points based on your actual holdings.  
  The larger and longer your holdings, the more bfUSD HODL points you accumulate. The exact multipliers and thresholds are defined on the Points page.

- **Boost Points**  
  When you meet certain bfUSD-related conditions (for example, holding a required amount of hbfUSD / pbfUSD, or providing a certain amount of bfUSD liquidity), your bfUSD HODL points receive an extra boost.  
  Boosts are applied as a multiplier on top of your base bfUSD HODL points, and the detailed rules are shown on the Points page.

- **Referral Points**  
  Points earned when your invited users receive HODL points.  
  The rule is: for every 10 HODL points your referred users earn, you receive 1 referral point.  
  The exact ratio and validity criteria for referrals are explained on the Points page.

- **Galxe Points**  
  Points earned by completing quests on Galxe, including both HODL-related and Social-related quests.  
  Galxe points are usually distributed in multiple batches according to each campaign’s rules.

- **Ecosystem Partner Points**  
  Points earned by participating in BitFi ecosystem partner projects, such as using bfBTC / bfUSD in YieldNest, Cygnus, RollX, DeSyn, Turtle Club, and other protocols, when you meet the specified conditions.



## How to Earn Points

- **Epoch-Based Settlement**  
  BitFi takes a snapshot of user balances and quest completion status at the end of each epoch and distributes points according to the current rules.  
  One epoch is approximately 24 hours, with one settlement per day.

- **bfBTC Holding Example**  
  If you hold 0.00018 bfBTC, under the current rule you will earn 10 points per epoch.  
  Points are distributed as whole numbers only, and decimal parts are not counted.

- **bfUSD Quests and Holdings**  
  - Completing bfUSD one-time quests such as first mint, first stake, or first liquidity provision grants one-time points.  
  - In each epoch, the system grants bfUSD HODL points based on your holdings of bfUSD, hbfUSD, pbfUSD, and bfUSD liquidity positions.  
  - If you meet the Boost conditions, additional Boost points are granted on top of your base HODL points.

- **Other Quests and Limits**  
  Social quests, ecosystem partner quests, and other campaign-based quests grant points according to their specific rules.  
  The exact values, caps, and timing of point distributions are always defined by the Points page and official announcements.
