# Contract ABI

The ABI of bfBTC contracts can be categorized into two types, with slight differences between them:

* Contracts that use ERC20 assets as underlying assets
* Contracts that use Gas Tokens as underlying assets



1. Contracts that use ERC20 assets as underlying assets

[Download ERC20 ABI (JSON)](/assets/bfbtc-contract-abi-erc20.json)



2. Contracts that use Gas Tokens as underlying assets (Only on Bitlayer)

[Download Gas Token ABI (JSON)](/assets/bfbtc-contract-abi-gastoken.json)



All contracts have been verified on their respective network explorers. You can also interact with the contracts directly through the appropriate block explorer for each network.
